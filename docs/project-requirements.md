## 7. System Architecture & Design

### 7.1 Architecture Diagrams
The following diagrams are attached to provide a comprehensive view of the system architecture:

1. **Application Architecture** - `diagrams/application-architecture.md`
   - Illustrates the three-layer architecture: Frontend, Backend, and Database
   - Shows interactions between different system components
   - Highlights key modules like Local Storage and Rich Text Editor

2. **Data Flow Diagram** - `diagrams/data-flow.md`
   - Demonstrates the flow of data during note operations
   - Shows synchronization between local storage and backend
   - Illustrates the export/import process

3. **Database Schema** - `diagrams/db-schema.md`
   - Details the relationships between different entities
   - Defines data structure for Users, Notebooks, Sections, Subsections, and Documents
   - Includes field definitions and relationships

4. **User Flow** - `diagrams/user-flow.md`
   - Maps the user journey through core operations
   - Shows decision points and process flows
   - Includes document creation and management flows

5. **Component Structure** - `diagrams/component-structure.md`
   - Outlines the hierarchy of React components
   - Shows relationships between different UI elements
   - Details the utility layer components
